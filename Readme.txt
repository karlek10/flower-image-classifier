Dear Reviewer,
I kindly submit my Project. The .zip file includes this short readme, my workbook as .html, trai.py, predict.py and auxiliary.py which contains the required functions to run train.py and predict.py.

All three .py files have been written in Spyder 4.1.3 and Python 3.7, and tested, with successful results. With 7 epochs of training the predict.py predicts most of the test flowers with very high precision. 


Sincerely, 
Karlo Leskovar
